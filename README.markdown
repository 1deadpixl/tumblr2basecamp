## Requirements

* PHP, preferably 5.3.8+
* (Optional) [DISQUS API bindings for PHP](https://github.com/disqus/disqus-php) — none of these .php files require the bindings. Only use the bindings if you know you need them and already know how to use them.

## Usage

Run any of these files from your PHP installation. Enjoy!

## Requests

[Email us any requests](http://disqus.com/support).

Note: The integrity and utility of these recipes is very important to us. This means keeping them tidy and aimed at a wide audience. If you request a very specific recipe we may make it less specific so it's more accessible.

## Support

These recipes are meant as a starting point, so most recipes have only been tested to work with PHP 5.3.8 in Chrome 17+.
